    // public = anyone has access to this class/attribute/function
    // private = no-one can see this class/attribute/function. Kinda like in the in the real world.
    // should the user be able to change it? What can the user use out of this object?
    // We start thinking about a client and a server. The client is an object that calls a method on another object.
// and the server is an object that does an operation on behalf of another object. We've been doing this already:

    // objects talk to each other and collaborate! like System.out.println. or PrintStream out = System.out.
// Scanner and System are the server (service to help me do something)... and I'm the client
    //


    // how do you want the client to use this class?
public class Person {
    public String firstName;
    public String lastName;
}
